# Injectable Virtual Keyboard

Quickly built using [Svelte Keyboard](https://github.com/russellsamora/svelte-keyboard) by Russell.


### Why?
I needed a virtual keyboard for a stand alone touch device for an authentication service. This is probably not the most elegent solution for this.


### Future?
- Write my own keyboard module for better key customization.
- Make it work better than currently.

### Issues
- Will not open keyboard if focused faster than loaded.
- Position fixed to bottom so scrolling may be an issue.
